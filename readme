for now the only thing working is an echo 2 way server 
it consists of a websocket connection and asynchronous connection of as many clients as u like . 




run:

python -m venv .venv

pip install fastapi uvicorn websockets uuid asyncio


to run the server: 

uvicorn server.src.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

to run a client: 

python chat-app\client.python
